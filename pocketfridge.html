        <h1><strong>pocket fridge case study</strong></h1>
        <p class="study-text">
          <b class="heading">Background</b>
          I find myself having to throw forgotten and unfinished food items out from my fridge when the expiration date has passed. I'm sure others have felt the same way, which is why food waste in the USA per year is up to 40% of the food supply.
          <br><br>
          <strong class="emph">
            My team and I created an application called Pocket Fridge that could help solve this problem by providing a convenient way to track grocery items and their expiration dates.
          </strong><br>
          Pocket Fridge also allows users to create accounts and add housemates with a shared fridge and shared grocery shopping lists. To further reduce possible food waste, the application also provides a variety of recipes from an API that users can search through to use up items in their fridge before they expire, as well as view food waste data for the entire household.
        </p>
          

        <p class="study-text">
            <b class="heading">Problem Statement</b>
            People often waste food because they do not have a way to conveniently track grocery items and
            their expiration dates in their fridge. Additionally, they cannot find ways to use the items in
            dishes when they cook which leads to more waste.
        </p>

        <p class="study-text">
          <b class="heading">Feature List</b>
          We compiled a feature list that we wished to implement in our project and used it as reference.

                    <p>
                      We found through individual research that food waste has become a large environmental concern. More specifically, people needed help tracking things in their fridge before they expire. In addition, they may lack the creativity for them to come up with ways to use the ingredients they have. Thus, we found that there are many areas people could use some help with in terms of reducing their food waste.

                    <p>
                      Our idea was an iOS application that allowed users to
                      <ul>
                        <li>keep track of food items they bought so they would know what they had in their inventory and when they expire</li>
                        <li>create custom shared grocery lists with their households</li>
                        <li>view recipes that use items in the user's inventory</li>
                        <li>keep track of their food waste (expired items' weight and cost would be added to an annual total)</li>
                      </ul>
                      Our target users were people in a shared household, such as families or housemates, but the app could be useful to anyone.

                    <p>
                      We designed iOS sample screens using Figma, including a sign up and log in page, a fridge page to display the inventory, a shopping list page, a recipe page, a food waste stats page, and a profile page.
                      <br><br>
                      We also had key features like adding and removing items and recipes, but did not include more ambitious features like barcode scanning and notifications since we weren't sure whether we could implement them all within our 8 week time limit.

                      We spent a period of time learning the tech stack for our project which included React-Native, Xcode, and GitHub, then we divided up tasks between a backend team and a frontend team.

                    <p>
                      Our team wanted to create a React Native application on Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and 
                      use Xcode to run the simulation. We began to create the UI and set up the backend database and network simultaneously within each respective sub-team.
                      <br><br>
                      Unfortunately, we were unable to successfully run Xcode on the entire team's laptops, so we switched to using AWS amplify to simulate our application on a web browser.
