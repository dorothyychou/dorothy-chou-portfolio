        <h1><strong>pocket fridge case study</strong></h1>
        <p class="study-text">
            <b class="heading">Background</b>
            I find myself having to throw forgotten and unfinished food items out from my fridge when
            the expiration date has passed. I'm sure others have felt the same way, which is why food
            waste in the USA per year is up to 40% of the food supply. My team and I decided to create
            an application called Pocket Fridge that could help solve this problem by providing a
            convenient way to track grocery items and their expiration dates. Pocket Fridge also allows
            users to create accounts and add housemates with a shared fridge and shared grocery shopping
            lists. To further reduce possible food waste, the application also provides a variety of
            recipes from an API that users can search through to use up items in their fridge before they
            expire, as well as view food waste data for the entire household for users to hold each other
            accountable.

            <b class="heading">Problem Statement</b>
            People often waste food because they do not have a way to conveniently track grocery items and
            their expiration dates in their fridge. Additionally, they cannot find ways to use the items in
            dishes when they cook which leads to more waste.

                    <p>
                      We spent one week brainstorming for a project idea and found through research that food
                      waste has become a large environmental concern and many people need help in reducing their food waste. More specifically, they need help with keeping track of things in their fridge before they expire so they aren't forced to throw bad food away. Also, humans are naturally forgetful, so they could use reminders that let them know what food they already own or what food is about to expire. People may not actually be aware of how much waste they produce or how large of an impact their waste may have. In addition, they may lack the creativity for them to come up with ways to use the ingredients they have. Thus, we found that there are many areas people could use some help with in terms of reducing their food waste.

                    <p>
                      Our original idea for the app was an iOS application that allowed users to keep track
                      of food items they buy so they would know exactly what they had in their “inventory,” 
                      preventing them from buying duplicate items. We planned for the app to have a barcode 
                      scanner, and the user would be able to scan items' barcodes to add them to their inventory. Upon scanning, the item's expiration date would be attached to the item in the user's virtual inventory. To prevent the user from throwing away expired food, the app would notify the user when an item is about to expire. Additionally, the app would recommend recipes using the items in the user's inventory and remind users when their stock is running low. They could create custom grocery lists and also be told where the nearest place to find an item is. The app could also help people track their spending and grow good spending habits, since it would let people know how much food they should buy for their household. Finally, the app would allow users to keep track of their food waste. When items expire, their weight and cost would be added to an annual total. Ideally, being reminded of the amount of food they were actually wasting would be motivating for users to keep their numbers low. Our target users were people who live in a shared household, such as families or college housemates, but the app could be useful to anyone.

                    <p>
                      We designed iOS sample screens using Figma. Our sample screens included a sign up and log in page, a fridge page to display the inventory, a shopping list page, a recipe page, a food waste stats page, and a profile page. We also had key features such as adding and removing items and recipes, but we did not include more ambitious features such as barcode scanning and notifications since we were unsure whether we would be able to implement them all within our 8 week time limit.

                      We spent a period of time learning the tech stack for our project, then we divided up tasks between a backend team and a frontend team.

                    <p>
                      Our team wanted to create a React Native application on Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and 
                      use Xcode to run the simulation. We began to create the UI and set up the backend database and network simultaneously within each respective sub-team. Unfortunately, we were unable to successfully run Xcode on the entire team's laptops, so we switched to using AWS amplify to simulate our application on a web browser.
